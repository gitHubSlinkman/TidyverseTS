Hello.  My name is Craig Slinkman and I am a retired professor of business 
statistics.  I spentdo most of my work in the ridy verse `r 2017 - 1979 +1` 
teaching business statistics in the College of Business Statistics at the
University of Texas at Arlington.

I am an avid R user.   I live the  tidyverse. 
This document was produced in RStudio. 

This is an introduction of how to use the tidy verse to produce forecasting models.
It is made from a number of tutorials that can be found on the Internet.
